# 🔐 Natas1 Walkthrough

Same thing here, but apperently the right click option will be disabled, however if you
just change the url from natas0 -> natas1. Change:
```
http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
```
to:
```
http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
```
The inspector tab will stay open, then just repeat instruction from natas0.



## :boom: Alternatively
You can use the shortcut for opening the web inspector `ctrl+shift+c`.

This will grant you access as before.
