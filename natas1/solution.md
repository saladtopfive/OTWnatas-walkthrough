# Natas1 walkthrough

Same thing here, but apperently the right click option will be disabled, however if you
just change the url from natas0 -> natas1 for example:

```
http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

			|
			|
			V

http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

```


the inspector tab will stay open, then just repeat instruction from natas0.
