Welcome to my walkthrough repository for the **Natas** wargame on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/). This repo contains solutions and step-by-step explanations for each level in the Natas series, serving as both a learning tool and a personal reference.

## 📘 What is Natas?

**Natas** is a web security wargame focused on server-side vulnerabilities, covering topics like:

- Basic HTTP authentication
- Source code analysis
- Directory traversal
- SQL injection
- Command injection
- and more…

## 📁 Structure

Each level has its own folder:


Inside each folder:

- `solution.md` contains a detailed explanation and steps taken to complete the level.
- Screenshots or code snippets may be included as needed.

## 💡 Goal

This is primarily a learning project. By writing these walkthroughs:

- I'm reinforcing my understanding of web security fundamentals.
